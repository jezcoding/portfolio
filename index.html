          <h2>About<span> me</span></h2>
          <p> My name is Jestin, and I am a first-year college student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Cavite State University (CvSU). I’ve always been fascinated by technology—how it connects people, solves problems, and shapes the future—and choosing BSIT as my course felt like the right step toward turning that passion into a career.</p>

              <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
              <p> Aside from Java, I’ve also started learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which are essential for web development. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style them and make them visually appealing.
                With HTML, I learned how to use different tags like h1 to h6 for headings, p for paragraphs, and a for links. I can also create lists, insert images, and build forms. With CSS, I explored how to apply colors, fonts, margins, and layouts to a page. I’ve practiced creating simple websites with headers, footers, navigation bars, and responsive designs.              
                What I enjoy most about HTML and CSS is seeing the immediate result of my code on the browser. It’s satisfying to take a blank page and turn it into something that looks clean and professional. These languages have helped me understand how websites are built from the ground up, and I’m looking forward to learning JavaScript next to make my websites interactive. </p>

              <h4>Python</h4>
              <p> Another language I’ve been exploring is Python, which has quickly become one of my favorites. Python is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it great for beginners like me. Even though I’ve only learned the basics, I already appreciate how powerful and flexible Python is.

                I’ve learned how to write simple Python scripts that involve variables, loops, if-else conditions, and functions. I also practiced using lists and dictionaries, which helped me understand how to manage data. One project I completed was a basic quiz app that asked users questions and scored their answers.
                
                Python’s simplicity helped me focus more on logic rather than complex syntax. I also learned that Python is widely used in data science, machine learning, and automation—fields I’m very interested in exploring in the future. For now, I’m working on improving my skills through small exercises and challenges, and I hope to take on more advanced projects soon.

              <h4>Java</h4>
              <p> As a first-year Information Technology student at Cavite State University, one of the first programming languages I was introduced to is Java. I’ve learned that Java is a powerful, object-oriented language commonly used in building desktop applications, Android apps, and enterprise-level systems. At first, I found Java a bit challenging because of its strict syntax and structure, but over time, I started to understand the logic behind it.

                I have basic knowledge of Java, such as how to create variables, use loops and conditionals, and define classes and methods. One of the first programs I wrote was a simple calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. That project helped me practice how Java handles input and output, as well as basic operations.
                
                What I like about Java is that it teaches you how to write organized and reusable code. Learning object-oriented concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance gave me a better understanding of how large programs are built. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m excited to continue improving my skills in Java</p>

            <h3>Hobbie 1</h3>

            <p>One of my favorite ways to relax and unwind is by watching anime. I enjoy the creativity, unique storytelling, and emotional depth that anime offers. Whether it's action-packed series like Attack on Titan or heartwarming stories like Your Name, anime takes me to different worlds and helps me see life from different perspectives. It also inspires my imagination and sometimes even influences how I think about characters when programming games or designing websites.

                  <p> Playing online games is not just a hobby for me—it’s also a way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and connect with friends. I enjoy competitive games where I can test my strategy and teamwork. Games like Mobile Legends or Valorant are not only fun but also teach me how to stay calm under pressure and work as part of a team. Gaming helps me relax after studying and reminds me that learning can be fun and interactive, especially when related to IT. </p>

                        <p> Volleyball is one of the sports I enjoy the most. I love the energy and teamwork involved in every match. Every time I step on the court, I feel more focused and motivated to give my best. Playing volleyball has taught me discipline, communication, and how to trust my teammates. It’s also a great way for me to stay active and take a break from time spent in front of a computer screen. </p>

                              <p> Basketball has always been one of my favorite sports because it pushes me physically and mentally. I enjoy the thrill of the game—the fast pace, the strategy, and the challenge of improving my skills. It helps me stay fit and teaches me about persistence and leadership. Even just shooting hoops with friends gives me a sense of balance between academics and physical activity. </p>

                                    <p> Badminton may seem simple at first, but it’s a game that requires quick reflexes and focus, which I really enjoy. It’s a sport I often play with friends or family, and I like how it keeps me moving and energized. It’s also a great stress reliever and gives me a break from screen time. Whether I win or lose, I always enjoy the fast-paced rallies and the fun of the game. </p>

                                        <p>Baking is a hobby I enjoy when I want to slow down and be creative in a different way. There’s something satisfying about following a recipe and turning ingredients into something delicious. I especially enjoy baking cookies and simple cakes. It teaches me patience, precision, and the joy of sharing something I made with others. Baking also gives me a sense of accomplishment, just like completing a coding project. </p>
